        <h2>Welcome everyone!</h2>
        <p>My name is Lilian Lamb and I am a computer engineer. I earned my bachelor's at the University of South Carolina. While at school, I used the time to explore my major and interests through classes and research. I have accumulated the summary of my work here.</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at USC, I have accumulated the projects and assignments I have had and uploaded their respective codes to Git Hub. Each class focused on a different topic, language, and/or skill so the page exemplifies everything I have learned and accomplished in my classes. This page is also a repository of links to each class.</p>

        <h2>Publications and Honors</h2>
        <p>Due to the research I participated in during my collegiate years, I have several publications in varying journals. The publications focus on the research I did with Dr. Vasconcelos, focusing on identifying computer science stereotypes in early education majors. On top of my publications, I have earned two honors (Graduation with Leadership Distinction in research and Profesional and Civic Engagement). One requirement to complete the honor is to assemble a portfolio. Both portfolios exemplify the beyond-the-classroom experiences I underwent during my undergrad and include a reflection of what I have learned. This page showcases the publications and honors I have earned.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I have worked with three different professors with three different focuses: Dr. Lima de Vascalones (focusing on identifying computer science stereotypes in early education majors), Dr. Voulgaris (working on a self-positioning platform for aquatic data collection), Dr. Rekleitis (working in the autonomous field robotics labs). This page exemplifies the work I did with each professor and project. </p>
